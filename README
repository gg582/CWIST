# CWIST - C Web development Is Still Trustworthy

CWIST is a modern, lightweight C web framework designed for building secure and scalable applications. It brings the ergonomics of modern web frameworks to C without sacrificing performance or control.

== FEATURES ==

- HTTP/1.1 Server: Robust request parsing and response handling.
- SString: Custom string library with compare and substr support.
- WebSocket Support: Easy upgrade from HTTP to persistent connections.
- Middleware System: Chainable processing for logging and security.
- Path Parameters: Express-style routing with :param support and Mux Router.
- JSON Builder: Lightweight utility using cJSON for response building.
- Static Assets & DB Sharing: Serve directories with `cwist_app_static` and reuse SQLite handles via `cwist_app_use_db`.
- Nuke DB: High-performance In-Memory SQLite with persistent disk synchronization (`cwist_nuke_init`).
- Secure by Design: Built-in integration with Monocypher.

== QUICK START ==

1. Installation:
$ git clone [https://github.com/your/cwist.git](https://github.com/your/cwist.git)
$ cd cwist
$ make install

2. Hello World (main.c):

3. Compilation:
$ gcc -o server main.c -lcwist -lssl -lcrypto -luriparser -lcjson -ldl -lpthread
$ ./server

== NUKE DB ==

Nuke DB is a **Read-Optimal Persistent Store**. It follows a "Read-from-RAM, Write-to-Disk" philosophy:
- **Ultra-Fast Reads**: All queries are executed against an in-memory SQLite instance, providing sub-millisecond response times for read-heavy workloads.
- **Reliable Writes**: Every `COMMIT` triggers an immediate background synchronization to the physical disk (WAL mode), ensuring your data is safe even if the process crashes.
- **Trade-off**: While write performance is slightly affected by disk I/O synchronization, the system guarantees that reads remain unblocked and consistently fast.
- **Raw Bootstrap**: On startup, the on-disk SQLite file is read directly as a raw image (`sqlite3_deserialize`) so the in-memory copy is hydrated without walking through the backup API.

Usage:
1. `cwist_nuke_init("data.db", 5000);` // Loads data.db to memory, enables auto-sync every 5s + immediate sync on commit.
2. Use `cwist_nuke_get_db()` to access the high-speed in-memory handle.
3. On application exit (SIGINT/SIGTERM), Nuke DB performs a final safety sync.
4. **Safety**: If the initial load from disk fails (corrupted file), Nuke DB enters a read-only disk protection mode to prevent overwriting your data.

== DEPENDENCIES ==

- cJSON ([https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON))
- OpenSSL (libssl, libcrypto)
- uriparser
- (SQLite3 is now statically embedded)

== PAST ROADMAP ==

- Security: CORS middleware and origin / header policy management.
- RestAPI: Dedicated features for optimized RestAPI server deployment.
